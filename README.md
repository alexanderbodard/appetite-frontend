# Appetite

Appetite is concept for which the prototype was made during 'HACK.MOSCOW 2019' in a 36 hour time span. It presents a mobile app for ordering at a restaurant, such that waiters could serve people more efficiently. Furthermore, the menu becomes dynamic in the sense that the application suggests dishes to each customer based on previous choices.
Further features include a reservation tool and data analytics for restaurant owners, giving insights in how to make their business more profitable.

This repository contains the prototype for the mobile Flutter app Appetite. Because of time limitations, the only goal was to make a working prototype and no effort has been put in clean software design. 

Note: As the Appetite backend server is no longer being hosted, certain features will be unavailable.
